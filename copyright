Copyright: .NET Foundation and contributors. All rights reserved.
License:   MS-RL
 This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the
 software, you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not
 use the software.
 .
 1. Definitions
 The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution"
 have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.
 A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the
 software.
 A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this
 license.
 "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its
 contribution.
 .
 2. Grant of Rights
 (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the
 license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a
 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its
 contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its
 contribution or any derivative works that you create.
 (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
 conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a
 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to
 make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose
 of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in
 the software.
 .
 3. Conditions and Limitations
 (A) Reciprocal Grants- For any file you distribute that contains code from the
 software (in source code or binary format), you must provide recipients the
 source code to that file along with a copy of this license, which license will
 govern that file. You may license other files that are entirely your own work
 and do not contain code from the software under any terms you choose.
 (B) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
 contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.
 (C) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you
 claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor
 to the software ends automatically.
 (D) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
 copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the
 software.
 (E) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may
 do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license
 with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in
 compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies
 with this license.
 (F) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The
 contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may
 have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license
 cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors
 exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
 purpose and non-infringement.
Comment:
 Note on license compatibility from Paolo Bonzini:
 the MS-RL-licensed .wxs files are only ever compiled by wixl, and never
 mix with C or Vala sources in a single derivative binary.  Therefore,
 MS-RL's GPL- and LGPL-incompatibility is not an issue for the purpose
 of distributing msitools itself.
 .
 MS-RL derivatives may end up in the same .msi files as
 incompatibly-licensed binaries provided by the end user of msitools, but
 that should not be a problem either: the GPLed binaries are essentially
 data as far as the installer is concerned, and the installer tables are
 not used by the GPLed binaries either.  Therefore, this should count
 as mere aggregation, and mere aggregation in the same file shouldn't be
 a problem because the structure of the OLE compound document keeps the
 parts separate.  It's basically the same that happens when you download
 an ISO full of RPM packages, since the OLE compound document can be
 considered a file system just as much as ISO9660 can.
 .
 However, we will have to be careful if msitools grows more XML sources
 that will be compiled by wixl.  Such files may not be licensed under GPL
 or LGPL.  This is not a problem; for such files it does make sense to
 use the MIT license or the MS-RL to facilitate interoperability with WIX.
